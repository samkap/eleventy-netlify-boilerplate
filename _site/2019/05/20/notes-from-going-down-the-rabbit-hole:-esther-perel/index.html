datetime="2019-05-20">20 May 2019</time></small><p>I’ve gone down a really good rabbit hole. Today, I was catching up with a friend and even bookmarked some things we talked about on my site bookmarks list.</p><p>We talked about Esther Perel being on <a href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/esther-perel">Dax Shepard’s Armchair Expert podcast</a>. From there I immediately got on the audiobook loan list at my library, and watched not one, but two long features of her talks.</p><p>She’s a therapist and author to works with and writes about relationships, infidelity, trust, and more. Some romantic, some self. A whole lot of growth-related topics.</p><p>I didn't take notes for all of this, as I was also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxtYDnMFGAY/?igshid=psgflf9suu4h">making dinner</a> but thought I’d share what I gathered while watching and listening from at least one of her talks.</p><div class="limit"><div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//5iu9_8Vsmtk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><ul><li>What you did is what your [parent] did</li><li>We have unprecedented freedom yet we have to negotiate <strong>everything.</strong> Who’s picking up the baby? Who should I date?</li><li>Every (American/Western-raised) person wants a solution, but rather it demands the understanding of the past</li><li>In community we got a lot of continuity, consistence, and were never alone. Now we look to our partners for the existential aloneness to be solved.</li></ul><blockquote><p>You don't solve this with Victoria’s Secret. And there isn't a Victor’s Secret, so we all know where the responsibility lies</p></blockquote><ul><li>Intimacy = into me see. I show you my inner life.</li><li>Everyone struggle with change in stability. The thriving ones know how to reconcile that.</li><li>Some need more protection, some need more space. And if you're in relationships sometimes there in a two-person couple, there is usually one who is each. One afraid of abandonment, and one afraid of suffocation.</li><li>Romantic love, presently, has replaced all the things we used to look for in the perfect world of the divine.</li><li>In the swiping culture, &quot;when I find you, I no longer think I can do better.&quot; And, <strong>&quot;When I find you, I will delete my app&quot;</strong></li><li>Too many options, more uncertainty and more self-doubt</li><li>Sex was for reproduction, and now its for wanting. There are a lot of conditions to fill now. There is a lot more pressure</li><li>Patriarchy dismantles men’s vulnerability, makes them less likely to live long, and not be the best partners. For women, we know a lot of what it does. <strong>If we have a paradigm change then we can leave this binary gender construct.</strong></li><li>In the village you could hear every fight and every fuck. The walls were porous. Her podcast works to react the village in a virtual sence.</li><li>When we listen deeply to other people, we reach deep into their humanity... ...We get to listen to their <strong>otherness</strong>.</li><li>When we listen deeply to other people, we end up standing in front of ourselves in the mirror</li><li>Every conference talks about the future of food, the future of tech, but none on the future of relationships</li><li><strong>Write well, and edit often.</strong></li><li>The life of women will not change, until men come along with them.</li><li>We need our relationships to exist in a larger social context. When the thought of not being ab</li><li>The ultimatum to the other person. You need to know what you can live with.</li><li>Stable ambiguity: we're together just enough to be together, not to feel alone. Stuck in a SA state. Have this conversation with other people.</li><li>Post traumatic growth: intergenerational trauma can go through generation</li><li>Give yourself the permission to thrive and experience joy from that</li><li>In long distance relationships: understand the difference between intimacy and surveillance. Instead of &quot;what did you do today?&quot;, focus on the distance and make it the front and center. Write a letter. When you write a letter, you're with yourself and the other person.</li><li>Monogamy used to be one person for life, not one person at a time.</li></ul><p>Her talk at Bumble at SXSW also stood out to me. For one, it was in Austin.
