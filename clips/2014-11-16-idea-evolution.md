Just read a quote by Jason Santa Maria in his recent [Pastry Box Project post](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/jason-santa-maria/2014-november-15) that I thought I’d share.

> Because the real shape of an idea isn’t an explosion, but **evolution**. In order for an idea to become something valuable, it needs to be nurtured.
