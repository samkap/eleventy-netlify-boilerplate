Mark your calendars and sign up! I’m joining [QTBIPOC Design](https://qtbipoc.design/) for a book club chat next Tuesday, June 20th, at 7pm EST ([find your timezone's local time here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20230620T230000&p1=24))! I’m excited that they chose Inclusive Design Communities as their June book!

QTBIPOC Design is all about giving LGBTQ+ designers of color access to free education, mentorship, & networking opportunities. They’re doing critical work that our industry needs.

[Sign up for the book club](https://qtbipoc.design/event/inclusive-design-communities) and share it with the designers and design teams in your life!
