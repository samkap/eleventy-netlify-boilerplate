 Note: This is part 2 of a [short series](https://samkapila.com/2022/09/27/what-it-was-like-to-write-a-book-(part-1)/) about the experience of writing my book, [Inclusive Design Communities](https://abookapart.com/products/inclusive-design-communities).

I wanted to write more about the writing process and what worked for me. 

## Separating building and editting

I learned a lesson about writing that I believe is so true about design: There needs to be a phase for building what the core concepts are and another stage for editing and making everything flow together. My editors and publisher knew that, but I hadn't made the connection with design. I wish I could recall where I heard something decades ago: that design was about 90% planning and problem solving and 10% of design software. The software didn't solve the problem or make the design good. It was for composing the other 90%.
