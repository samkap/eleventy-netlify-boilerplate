 Note: This is part 2 of a [short series](https://samkapila.com/2022/09/27/what-it-was-like-to-write-a-book-(part-1)/) about the experience of writing my book, [Inclusive Design Communities](https://abookapart.com/products/inclusive-design-communities), out on October 4th.

I wanted to write more about the writing process and what worked for me. I'm not a confident writer; my brain tends to go faster than my hand can write or type. In design work, my brain connects and notices patterns, but as I write, not all patterns make it down in the first go. I tend to lose the reader and end up feeling like that meme of Charlie Day attempting to solve a crime while looking forward wildly.

There are a few things that I noticed or learned while writing.

## Separate building and editting

I learned a lesson about writing that I knew was true about design: There needs to be a phase for building what the core concepts are and another stage for editing and making everything flow together. My editors and publisher knew that, but I hadn't made the connection with design. I wish I could recall where I heard something decades ago: that design was about 90% planning and problem-solving and 10% of design software. The software didn't solve the problem or make the design good. It was for composing the other 90%. 

In design, if we made things pixel perfect from the start, we'd take forever to get anything done. When you're working on putting something together, that's not the editting phase. It's like sculpting or ceramics; the details aren't there at the start, they're a part of the final stages, and the first parts are clumpy blobs building the structure. The clumpy blobs are good. That's where the story is. When the story feels like it's got all the pieces, *then* we can edit. 

## Understanding the process

I asked a small number of authors I knew or admired what it was like for them. And everyone's experiences were uniquely different. I also wanted to know more about what to expect; I'm the kind of person who studies a restaurant menu before she goes in. What courses was I going to eat on this journey?

I read two books in particular that helped me understand the process:

* \[Before and After The Book Deal: A Writer;s Guide to Finishing, Publishing, Promoting, and Surviving Your First Book](https://bookshop.org/books/before-and-after-the-book-deal-a-writer-s-guide-to-finishing-publishing-promoting-and-surviving-your-first-book-67a64da2-29cb-480b-9142-1355f857c3b2/9781948226400) by Courtney Maum
* \[You Should Write A Book](https://abookapart.com/products/you-should-write-a-book) by Katel LÃªdu and Lisa Maria Marquis, both at A Book Apart and such brilliant people to work with on this process.
