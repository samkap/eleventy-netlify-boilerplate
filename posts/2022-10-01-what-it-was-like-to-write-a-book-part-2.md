 Note: This is part 2 of a [short series](https://samkapila.com/2022/09/27/what-it-was-like-to-write-a-book-(part-1)/) about the experience of writing my book, [Inclusive Design Communities](https://abookapart.com/products/inclusive-design-communities).

I wanted to write more about the writing process and what worked for me. I'm not a confident writer, my brain tends to go faster than my hand can write or type. In design work, my brain connects and notices patterns, but as I write, not all of the patterns make it down in the first go. I tend to lose the reader and end up feeling like that meme of Charlie Day attempting to solve a crime while looking forward wildly.

There are a few things that I noticed or learned while writing.

## Separate building and editting

I learned a lesson about writing that I knew was true about design: There needs to be a phase for building what the core concepts are and another stage for editing and making everything flow together. My editors and publisher knew that, but I hadn't made the connection with design. I wish I could recall where I heard something decades ago: that design was about 90% planning and problem-solving and 10% of design software. The software didn't solve the problem or make the design good. It was for composing the other 90%. When you're working on putting something together, that's not the editting phase. It's like sculpting or ceramics; the details aren't there at the start, they're a part of the final stages and the first parts are clumpy blobs building the structure.
