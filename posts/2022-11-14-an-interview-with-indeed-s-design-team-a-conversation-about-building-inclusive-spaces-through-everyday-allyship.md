Recently, Indeed’s Design team interviewed me about Inclusive Design Communities, my new book with A Book Apart. The interview is called “Sam Kapila: Small acts can invite more voices into design communities.”

In the interview, the Indeed design team and I spoke about inclusion in many different ways including:

* Trying to balance going back and forth between wanting to talk or educate on marginalization and wanting to shut down, especially when I was feeling it myself,
* why thinking or requiring a design degree as the only viable form of design education is harmful to everyone,
* if systemic changes feel overwhelming, starting with one small step is a great way to start making an impact,
* how over the last few years, marginalized have had to comfort dominant identities (and our having to comfort or own their burden),
* characteristics of inclusive leaders,
* and, dealing with grief

I’m so grateful to Bet and Amy for including me, Katel for the introduction, and Sean for this incredible illustration. [Check it out!]()
