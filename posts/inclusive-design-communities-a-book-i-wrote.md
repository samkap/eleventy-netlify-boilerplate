Today, the pre-orders opened for my new book, [Inclusive Design Communities](https://abookapart.com/products/inclusive-design-communities) . YES! That means you can pre-order a book TODAY! Paperbacks are $29, E-books are $19, or you can get them both for $43.20. The book launches on October 4th, so you won’t have to wait too long. I worked on this book for years, through the pandemic, and I cannot wait to share it with you and see how we can all impact and improve the design community so it’s more inclusive with steps that anyone in any role can take.

This book covers a lot of ground. My friend, [Greg, said its about a 4-hour read](https://twitter.com/Brilliantcrank/status/1567583690557128704). I’ll be sharing more in the coming weeks, but to start, here’s an interview about the book that I did with the most amazing publishers an author could ask for, [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/). [Check it out](https://abookapart.com/blogs/press/meet-the-book-inclusive-design-communities) to learn more about the book!
