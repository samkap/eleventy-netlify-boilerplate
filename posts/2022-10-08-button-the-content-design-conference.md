I’m so excited to join [Button’s](https://twitter.com/ButtonConf) book club on Monday, October 10th, to talk about Inclusive Design Communities, the book I wrote with [A Book Apart](https://twitter.com/abookapart). I’ll be joining the Button Book Club segment remotely. Other books and authors featured include:

* Natalie Dunbar, *[From Solo to Scaled: Building a Sustainable Content Strategy](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/from-solo-to-scaled-building-a-sustainable-content-strategy-practice/)*
* Rebecca Evanhoe, [Conversations with Things](<* https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/conversations-with-things/>)
