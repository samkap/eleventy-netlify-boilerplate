I'm so excited to join [Button](https://twitter.com/ButtonConf)'s book club remotely on Monday, October 10th, to talk about Inclusive Design Communities, the book I wrote with [A Book Apart](https://twitter.com/abookapart). I'll be joining the Button Book Club segment that is both online and in person. Other books and authors featured include:

* Natalie Dunbar, *[From Solo to Scaled: Building a Sustainable Content Strategy](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/from-solo-to-scaled-building-a-sustainable-content-strategy-practice/)*
* Rebecca Evanhoe, https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/conversations-with-things/

The book club is hosted by the lovely Torrey Podmajersky! More info [here](https://www.buttonconf.com/2022-segments/the-button-book-club) and info to register [here](https://braintraffic.swoogo.com/button2022).
