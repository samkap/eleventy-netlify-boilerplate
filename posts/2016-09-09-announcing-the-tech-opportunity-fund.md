<p>Today, we are excited to announce the launch of the <a href="https://www.techopportunityfund.org/">Tech Opportunity Fund</a>, a partnership of organizations committed to providing $100 million in diversity scholarships to deserving students who want to enter the tech industry. We&#8217;ve joined with Code Fellows and OperationHOPE to lead this effort, and this morning, Vice President Joe Biden included the Fund in a speech he gave in St. Louis!</p>
<p>At The Iron Yard, we&#8217;ve committed to $40 million in full-tuition scholarships over the next five years. Code Fellows has committed to $5 million in scholarships and Operation HOPE will serve as the Fundâ€™s financial literacy and entrepreneur training partner. To reach our goal of $100 million in scholarships, we&#8217;ll need even more employers, code schools and civic organizations to join us.</p>
