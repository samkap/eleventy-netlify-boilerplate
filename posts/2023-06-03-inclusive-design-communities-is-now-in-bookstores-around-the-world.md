A Book Apart, the publishing house behind my book and so many career-changing books I love, just announced some pretty awesome news!

> We’re excited to announce that we’ve expanded book distribution globally—which means it’ll be even easier for you to buy A Book Apart books around the world, wherever you’re based.
>
> By expanding our distribution, ABA books will now be available through thousands of retailers (including your local independent bookstore), libraries, schools, and universities—in the US, UK, India, Japan, Germany, Australia, Brazil, and beyond.

All the books are available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Inclusive-Design-Communities-Sameera-Kapila/dp/1952616158/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=tTVZ9&content-id=amzn1.sym.bc5f3394-3b4c-4031-8ac0-18107ac75816&pf_rd_p=bc5f3394-3b4c-4031-8ac0-18107ac75816&pf_rd_r=E9FY3DXMJRTMM2S7X3EF&pd_rd_wg=uYdmk&pd_rd_r=2f5fa632-271e-40d1-9749-fe843e82e5ec&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m), [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22A+Book+Apart%22?Ntk=Publisher&Ns=P_Sales_Rank&Ntx=mode+matchall), [Blackwell’s](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/search?publisher=Book%20Apart&offset=0), [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/shop/abookapart), [Dussmann KulturKaufhaus](https://www.kulturkaufhaus.de/), [Book People](https://www.bookpeople.com/book/9781952616150), and many more! Buying directly from [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/products/inclusive-design-communities) is still an option for paperback or ebooks, and [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/inclusive-design-communities/id6443681832) will also have the ebook.

I just requested it from my local library on their website, and it was approved so quickly! With this new distribution model, you can request that your local library adds A Book Apart titles to their shelves, allowing even more folks to access the books at no cost! I’m so excited to take my family to the library and visit the book once it arrives. I have been dreaming of taking a selfie—or maybe a *shelfie*—with it.

If you’ve read the book or are going to, please rate it on any of these bookstore sites or on [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62985337-inclusive-design-communities)! Happy reading!
