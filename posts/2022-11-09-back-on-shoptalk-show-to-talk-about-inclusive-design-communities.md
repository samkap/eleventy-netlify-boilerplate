Last week, I was back on ShopTalk Show for the third time! [Chris](https://chriscoyier.net/), [Dave](https://daverupert.com/), and I talked about the book **Inclusive Design Communities** (on sale NOW at [abookapart.com](https://abookapart.com/products/inclusive-design-communities) ), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and ways we can reframe our thinking in various design spaces and ways to avoid them.
