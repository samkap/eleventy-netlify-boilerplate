Tim Smith, the host of The East Wing, interviewed me for his podcast. This is my first podcast interview and Tim was awesome to talk to. We spoke about design and education, but what stood out to me the most was how great of a host Tim is. He makes the interviewee very comfortable, he’s well-spoken, and all around a great guy!
