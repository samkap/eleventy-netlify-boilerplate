Clint Smith, author of [How The World Has Passed](https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/clint-smith/how-the-word-is-passed/9780316492935/), hosts a series of videos on [Black American history on Crash Course](https://youtu.be/xPx5aRuWCtc) including: the transatlantic slave trade, slavery, Elizabeth Key, slave codes, the Germantown Petition Against Slavery, The Stono Rebellion, Phyllis Wheatley, and so much more in 44 short lessons. Everything is explained in great detail and are an invaluable resource. 

You can watch in order, but these stand on their own—the first video I was introduced to was #4, the history of slave codes. Everyone should watch these. If you're worried about oppressive actions in schools against teaching American History (including Black American History), these will help fill in the gaps and you can share with others dealing with the same bans and restrictions. This history needs to be known.
