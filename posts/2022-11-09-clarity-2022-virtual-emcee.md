It’s once again time for [Clarity](https://www.clarityconf.com/)! This conference has become my favorite every year, whether remote or in-person, or if I attend as an attendee, speaker, and now virtual emcee! Clarity is THE design systems conference, run by Jina and a fantastic team of producers.


I look forward to it every year, and I’m excited to be the virtual emcee who’ll ask virtual speakers questions after their talks, host some giveaways, and post as many puns as I can into the chat! 



F﻿ind out more at [Clarityconf.com](https://www.clarityconf.com/)h ere are a LOT of great topics this year and if you can't attend there is an option to receive alld of the recordings
